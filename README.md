# Introduction

Welcome to the Nami Exchange API Documentation! You are now viewing the official documentation page for the Nami Exchange API. This guide offers full instructions on how to get started and efficiently utilize our API to manage and place orders.

### Getting Started



To start using the API, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an account**: Register a free account on the Nami Exchange website.
2. **Get the API key**: Go to Account Management > API Management to create a new API Key.
3. **Start using**: Use the provided API Key along with this API documentation to get started.



### API Access

* The base endpoint is: `https://nami.exchange/api/v1.0`
* All REST requests must be sent using the application/json content type. Non-HTTPS requests will be redirected to HTTPS, possibly causing functional or performance issues with your application.
* All REST requests will result in a `200 Ok` response unless there is a server or infrastructure error. The API result will be wrapped in a JSON Result object, where the `status` field indicates response status.
